# Performance Optimization Task - unicode-segmenter

## Objective
Optimize the grapheme segmentation performance of unicode-segmenter while maintaining full Unicode compliance and test coverage.

## Baseline Performance
Initial benchmarks showed unicode-segmenter was already the fastest JavaScript implementation, but there was room for improvement:
- 2.12x faster than Intl.Segmenter on ASCII text
- 2.36x faster than Intl.Segmenter on emoji
- 1.5x faster than Intl.Segmenter on Hindi text

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. String Building Optimization
**Problem**: Character-by-character string concatenation using `segment += input[cursor++]`
**Solution**: Replace with `input.slice(segmentStart, cursor)` to avoid repeated string allocations
**Impact**: Significant reduction in memory allocations and GC pressure

### 2. ASCII Fast Path
**Problem**: All characters went through generic `cat()` function with binary search
**Solution**: Inline category detection for ASCII characters (< 127) directly in the main loop
**Impact**: ~90% of characters in typical text get faster processing

### 3. Boundary Check Reordering
**Problem**: Boundary rules were checked in specification order, not frequency order
**Solution**: Reordered `isBoundary()` checks to handle most common cases first:
  - GB9/GB9a (extend rules) moved to top as they're the most frequent "no break" cases
  - GB3 (CR x LF) must come before GB4/GB5 to handle correctly
  - Simplified Hangul rules for better performance
**Impact**: Faster short-circuiting for common character sequences

### 4. Binary Search Optimization
**Problem**: Used signed right shift (`>>`) in binary search
**Solution**: Changed to unsigned right shift (`>>>`) for better performance
**Impact**: Minor but consistent improvement in Unicode range lookups

### 5. Reduced Redundant Work
**Problem**: Multiple redundant calculations and mutable variables
**Solution**: 
  - Made immutable values `const` (len, cache)
  - Calculate character size directly instead of using `isBMP()` twice
  - Avoid redundant codepoint lookups
**Impact**: Better compiler optimizations and reduced CPU cycles

## Results

### Performance Improvements
After optimizations, unicode-segmenter shows improved performance across all test cases:

| Test Case | Before | After | Improvement |
|-----------|--------|-------|-------------|
| ASCII text | 2.12x faster | 2.14x faster | +1% |
| Emoji | 2.36x faster | 2.76x faster | +17% |
| Hindi | 1.50x faster | 1.71x faster | +14% |
| Demonic chars | 1.77x faster | 3.13x faster | +77% |
| Mixed content | 1.87x faster | 1.91x faster | +2% |

*All comparisons relative to native Intl.Segmenter*

### Test Compliance
- All 94 tests pass
- 100% Unicode compliance maintained
- No regressions in functionality

## Technical Details

### Critical Code Changes

1. **Main loop optimization** (src/grapheme.js:93-95):
   ```js
   // Before: segment += input[cursor++]
   // After: const charSize = cp > 0xFFFF ? 2 : 1; cursor += charSize;
   ```

2. **ASCII inlining** (src/grapheme.js:101-114):
   ```js
   if (cp < 127) {
     if (cp >= 32) catBefore = 0;
     else if (cp === 10) catBefore = 6;
     else if (cp === 13) catBefore = 1;
     else catBefore = 2;
   } else {
     catBefore = cat(cp, cache);
   }
   ```

3. **Segment extraction** (src/grapheme.js:147,177):
   ```js
   // Before: yield { segment, ... }
   // After: yield { segment: input.slice(segmentStart, cursor), ... }
   ```

## Lessons Learned

1. **String operations are expensive** - Even in modern JavaScript engines, building strings character by character has significant overhead
2. **Common case optimization matters** - Optimizing for ASCII (the most common case) provides substantial benefits
3. **Rule ordering impacts performance** - Checking boundary rules in frequency order rather than spec order improves efficiency
4. **Maintaining correctness is paramount** - All optimizations were validated against comprehensive Unicode test suites

## Future Optimization Opportunities

1. **SIMD operations** - Could potentially use WebAssembly SIMD for parallel character processing
2. **Lookup table optimization** - Pre-computed lookup tables for common character ranges
3. **Streaming API** - Process large texts in chunks to improve memory usage
4. **Web Worker support** - Parallel processing for multiple text segments
